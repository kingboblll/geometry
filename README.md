# geometry
These are all the lessons I will be learning in geometry in Python files so I can put them on my calculator


Files are in bold, and the '*' is are functions

**Factoring**
- Factor
    * Use the quadratic formula to fix 'x'
    * Simplify 'x'


**Formulas**
- Rectangle
    * Area = Length * Width
    * Perimeter = 2 * Length + 2 * Width
    * Diagonal of a rectangle

- Parallelogram
    * Area = Base * Height
    * Perimeter = 2a + 2b (a and b are the lengths of the parallel sides)

- Factorial

- Triangle
    * Area = 1/2 * base * height
    * Perimeter = a + b + c (a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides)
		* Find A
		* Find B
		* Find C
		* Cosine
		* Sine
		* Tangent
		* cotangent
		* secant
		* cosecant

- Long division

- Square root a number

- Calculate pi (π)

- Circle
    * Area = pi * r^2 (r is the radius)
    * Circumference = 2 * pi * r

- Square
    * Area = Side^2
    * Perimeter = 4 * Side
    * Diagonal of a square

- Trapezoid
    * Area = 1/2 * (Base1 + Base2) * Height
    * Perimeter = Side1 + Side2 + Base1 + Base2

- Ellipse (Oval)
    * Area = pi * MajorRadius * MinorRadius
    * Circumference ≈ 2π * sqrt((MajorRadius^2 + MinorRadius^2) / 2)

- Arc (Curve)
    * Length of an arc = (θ/360°) * 2πR

- Sector (Part of a circle)
    * Area of a sector = (θ/360°) * πR^2 
    * Perimeter of a sector = 2 * Radius + ((θ/360°) * 2πR)
